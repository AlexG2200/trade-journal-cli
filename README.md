# Trade Idea & Stock Journal (V1)

This project is a **Python command-line (CLI) journal** designed for traders to log:
- **Weekly trade ideas** (ex: Sunday scans)
- **Aftermarket scans** (plans + key levels for the next trading day)

 **This is Version 1 (V1)** — a working foundation that I will continue improving and expanding over time.

## Why I Built This
As a trader, I wanted a simple and fast way to journal my trade ideas and next-day plans without needing a full app or complicated setup.  
This tool lets me build consistency, track my thinking, and review my ideas later.
